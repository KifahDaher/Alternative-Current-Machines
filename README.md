Alt-Alternative-Current-Machines
================================

    This project is focuse on analyzing two types of electric machines: the three-phase Symmetrical Induction machine
and the Synchronous machine. The symmetrical induction machine although known as induction machine usually 
converts electric power to mechanical work, thus the name induction motor. The synchronous machine often is used 
to convert mechanical power into electrical so it is a synchronous generator.

  This project is divided into three major parts; the first part is the dynamic analysis of a three-phase Induction 
motor with different scenarios to better observe and interpret the behavior of the machine. The second part investigates
a three-phase synchronous generator where different scenarios are done in order to analyze the performance of the machine 
under various scenarios. The third part consists of the combined model; a synchronous generator feeding an induction motor and different study cases are manipulated to examine the overall system.
